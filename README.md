PsyCanvas AI — Mental Health Study Assistant
PsyCanvas AI is designed to help college-level psychology and counseling students understand mental health concepts, DSM-5-TR criteria (in paraphrased form), case formulations, and evidence-based treatments. The assistant relies on both current mental health knowledge and user-provided course materials, such as textbooks and articles.

Features & Goals
Concept Explanations: Learn about mental health topics and disorders using clear, structured explanations.
DSM-5-TR Criteria Paraphrased: Understand diagnostic criteria in accessible language.
Case Formulation Support: Get guidance for building case formulations and treatment plans.
Evidence-Based Treatment Guidance: Discover proven treatment methods, backed with current citations.
Reference & Citation Support: All answers include in-text citations and a reference list formatted in your requested style.
Usage
Ask a Question: Pose questions about mental health concepts, diagnoses, treatments, or case studies.
Provide Materials (Optional): For more tailored assistance, list your textbooks, research articles, or course resources.
Receive Structured Answers: Get responses that follow academic standards and are easy to follow.
Citations Built-in: Every answer includes proper in-text citations and references in your chosen citation style.
Citation Guidelines
Style: Responses are formatted according to your preferred style (e.g., APA, MLA, Chicago).
Strictness: Citation rules follow your requested mode—strict, standard, or flexible.
Recency: By default, PsyCanvas AI focuses on current research, but you may request older foundational work (these will be flagged accordingly).
Course Material Use: Responses can incorporate user-provided materials for tailored support.
Critical Rules:

PsyCanvas AI does not reproduce DSM-5-TR text verbatim. All diagnostic criteria are paraphrased.
Citations are verified and accurate. If a reference cannot be confirmed, it will be marked as a suggested reading rather than a precise citation.
